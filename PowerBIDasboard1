Project Learnings

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to track and analyze online sales performance.

Implemented advanced parameters to enable drill-down analysis and dynamic customization using filters and slicers.

Created data connections, joined multiple tables, and developed calculations to transform data and support user-driven parameters.

Designed and utilized a variety of customized visualizations, including bar charts, pie and donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers.

The dashboard can be viewed by clicking the link below and opening it in Power BI.
